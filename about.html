<p> <h2> Rationale of using Python Notebook </h2></p>
<p> We demonstrated how to use Notebook to communicate with Single Cell Explorer system. <br>
   You can find more
  about why Jupyter is the data scientistsâ€™
    computational notebook of choice <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1"> here </a>.

<p> <h2>Why Django, not R Shiny?</h2> </p>
<p>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
   With tools including Django ORM, Middlewares, Authentication, HTTP libraries, Multi-site support, 
   i18n, Django Admin, and a template engine, it removes the hassle in Web development, database integration, and content
   management. We chose Django to make the development journey easier for the future.     
   <br>
   While Shiny is particularly great for fast prototyping and fairly easy to use, it has problems. R stack is weak in retrieving and saving data to the database and in multipage support. 
   Better concurrent user support requires Shiny Server Pro. <br> Also, it is hard to add extra functionality not already in the package or Dash.  </p>

<p><h2> Compared to Cellxgene software  </h2></p>
<p>Cellxgene is an interactive data explorer for checking single-cell transcriptomics datasets. However, the time 
   required to load h5ad files for a particular dataset or map to cellxgene makes it difficult for it to serve as a data portal for
   more datasets with concurrent users. </p>
